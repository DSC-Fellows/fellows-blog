This preliminary examination will offer an entry point to the perusals of Byron's library. It also fulfills part of my obligations as an inaugural Fellow of the [Digital Scholarship Centre](https://dsc.library.ualberta.ca/) at the University of Alberta, as this project was the successful proposal in winning this fellowship.

### Why?

So, the above question is actually three parts: why Byron, why Byron's library, and why visualizations?

<!-- more -->

### Byromania

Byron was famous in his time and he recognized this. There is a field of scholarship which has identified the confluence of factors that combined to see his meteoric rise as a poet and celebrity, but it is at least as interesting to see his contemporary audience themselves reacting to his ascent to the heights of fame.

One such observer, [Anna Isabella Milbanke](https://lordbyron.org/persRec.php?&amp;selectPerson=LyByron), wrote a poem encapsulating the allure of Byron in his years of fame:

> Woman! how truly called "a harmless thing!"   
So meekly smarting with the venom'd sting.   
Forgiving saints!—ye bow before the rod,   
And kiss the ground on which your censor trod... .   
Reforming Byron with his magic sway   
Compels all hearts to love him and obey—   
Commands our wounded vanity to sleep,   
Bids us forget the Truths that cut so deep,   
Inspires a generous candour to the mind   
That makes us to our friend's oppression kind.   
Amusing Patroness of passing whim   
Which calls the weaker sex to worship him,   
See [Caro](https://lordbyron.org/persRec.php?&amp;selectPerson=CaLamb1828), smiling, sighing, o'er his face   
In hopes to imitate each strange grimace   
And mar the silliness which looks so fair   
By bringing signs of wilder Passion there.   
Is Human nature to be cast anew,   
And modelled to your Idol's Image true?   
Then grant me, Jove, to wear some other shape,   
And be an anything—except an Ape!!

>> ~ The Byromania (1812)

Annabella would later marry Byron, become Lady Byron, and during the tumultuous year of their marriage before separation, their daughter Ada would be born - later [Ada Lovelace](https://lordbyron.org/persRec.php?&amp;selectPerson=AdByron1852), who would write [the first computer algorithm](https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html).

However, we get ahead of ourselves. 'The Byromania' speaks to the allure and "magic sway" of a poet whose quasi-autobiographical works could be projected back onto their author. With the first two cantos of *Childe Harold's Pilgrimage* (1812), Byron established in the eponymous protagonist the prototype for what would become recognized as the 'Byronic Hero'. Readers read Byron and read Byron into this character, as the dissipated young lord Harold's travels through the Mediterranean mirrored Byron's own Grand Tour through Portugal, Spain, Greece and Albania, while skirting Napoleonic France occupied central Europe. The persona and the person were then pursued by his readers through Regency London, Britain, and Europe in the ensuing years. His scandalous separation from his wife would lead him into a sort of self-imposed exile in 1816, and in the first part of this period he would conspire with [Percy Bysshe Shelley](https://lordbyron.org/persRec.php?&amp;selectPerson=PeShell1822), [Mary Godwin](https://lordbyron.org/persRec.php?&amp;selectPerson=MaShell1851) (soon to be Shelley) and [John Polidori](https://lordbyron.org/persRec.php?&amp;selectPerson=JoPolid1821) in the infamous ghost story telling competition that he devised at [Villa Diodati](https://www.jstor.org/stable/48571845) on Lake Geneva during the ['Year without a Summer'](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2016/10/25/year-without-summer/). This event would lead Mary Shelley to write *Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus* (1818), while John Polidori would [follow Byron's attempt](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25600775) at a tale of a revenant with the writing of *The Vampyre* (1819), which was [ascribed to Byron](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24301811) as author in its initial publication, with the antagonist of the tale taking on many of Byron's traits from aristocratic aloofness to brooding allure. Byron would move on to live in various cities of Italy, trying to aid in the Carbonari revolutionary movement to oust the Austrian-Habsburg presence, but, with the failure of these machinations, Byron moved on to Greece and an attempt to aid the Greek revolutionary cause against Ottoman rule. He would die there of an infection before much of the Greek effort saw success, but he is remembered for bringing his famous presence to the cause, especially because he died as a result.

So, Byron was famous in his time. A cursory corpus analysis of the relative frequency of the terms "Byron", "Napoleon", and "Shakespeare" reveals the heights of Byron's fame in relation to these two other famous figures from the battlefields of the day and the realms of rhyme, respectively.

<iframe width="800" height="325" name="ngram_chart" src="https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=Byron,Napoleon,+Shakespeare&amp;year_start=1750&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-2019&amp;smoothing=3" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Byron was a fan of Napoleon, in as much as he admired the French leader's heroic trajectory and bemoaned the two abdications from ["the throne of the world"](https://www.lordbyron.org/monograph.php?doc=ThMoore.1830&amp;select=AD1814#!Napoleon1AD1814.16-2) into his exiles. In marrying Annabella Milbanke, Byron was obliged to adopt a further name, Noel, meaning that the now Noel Byron shared initials with Napoleon Bonaparte, a triviality that delighted Byron.

Yet, Byron also reflected on his trajectory from fame to infamy, very much deconstructing the heroic journey with his mock heroic epic poem, *Don Juan* (1819-24). This work would feature a narrator voice that ostensibly was Byron's as author which provides constant playful commentary on the world and circumstances through which Byron and his readers were living. Hence, Byron could compare himself to Napoleon, albeit in his own arena:

> In twice five years the "greatest living poets",   
Like to [the Champion in the fisty ring](https://lordbyron.org/monograph.php?doc=ThMoore.1830&amp;select=AD1814.11),   
Is called on to support his claim or show it,   
Although 'tis an imaginary thing;   
Even I — albeit I’m sure I did not know it,   
Nor sought of foolscap subjects to be king,—   
Was reckon’d, a considerable time,   
The grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme.    

>> ~ *Don Juan*, Canto XI, Stanza LV

Byron's fame makes him an ideal candidate for analysis within his era, as he was an active and reactive agent who both consumed literature in the moment and consumed the literary moment such that his authorship transcended into celebrity.

### Bibliomania

Byromania was not the only craze of the Regency period. Indeed, the age saw a burgeoning of the book trade, both in new publications and also in antiquarian book auctions. Byron features in both.

The term "bibliomania" itself can be traced to the titles of works by two figures in the period appearing in the same year, 1809: [John Ferriar](https://lordbyron.org/persRec.php?&amp;selectPerson=JoFerri1815) in April and [Thomas Frognall Dibdin](https://lordbyron.org/persRec.php?&amp;selectPerson=ThDibdi1847) in response in May. Both their works were dedicated to the same individual, [Richard Heber](https://lordbyron.org/persRec.php?&amp;selectPerson=RiHeber1833), an extreme bibliophile.

Postscript Synopsis, "after the manner of Burton, prefixed to his *Anatomy of Melancholy*" from Dibdin's *Bibliomania* p. 83

***

Both works played upon the satirical allegorical figure of The Book Fool from Sebastian Brandt's 1494 *Das Narrenschiff* (or *Stultifera Navis* / *Ship of Fools*), with Dibdin's work explicitly taking an epigraph and the Albrecht Dürer woodcut of this Book Fool. It is in this shared figure of the Book Fool and their shared address to Heber that the two authors identify this new phenomenon of obsessively conspicuous consumption of books, which they understatedly referred to as book-collecting. Heber, though also a scholar and bibliographer with connections to the literary circles of the day, [including Byron's](https://lordbyron.org/monograph.php?doc=ThMoore.1830&amp;select=AD1813.63), was notorious for his purchasing of libraries at auction, sometimes wholesale, with these furnishing or fully occupying various homes and warehouses both in London and across cities in Europe. [By Dibdin's estimate](https://books.google.ca/books?id=7vA20AEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA366#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), at the time of his death in 1833, Heber had some 120,000 volumes in England alone.

Aside from the publication of these two works, if there can be said to be an exemplifying and encapsulating event in the antiquarian book craze, it would be the sale of John Ker, 3rd Duke of Roxburghe's library in 1812 by [Robert Harding Evans](https://lordbyron.org/persRec.php?&amp;selectPerson=RoEvans1857) - the same Evans that would draw up Byron's library for sale a year later and actually sell Byron's library in 1816 and again in 1827.

This immense sale drew the foremost collectors of books in the day and in its wake led to the establishing of The Roxburghe Club, whose members could share their passion for collecting the curious and rare.

Thomas Frognall Dibdin would be party to the convening of the inaugural meeting of the Roxburghe Club, while also later publishing an account of the events that transpired during the Roxburghe library sale in his *The Bibliographical Decameron*.

[![content?id=wORRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U1ik8ztyAlyI5OUgWoi-7fkmzb_ow&amp;ci=66%2C66%2C829%2C1463&amp;edge=0](https://books.google.ca/books/content?id=wORRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U1ik8ztyAlyI5OUgWoi-7fkmzb_ow&amp;ci=66%2C66%2C829%2C1463&amp;edge=0)](https://books.google.ca/books?id=wORRAAAAcAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=bibliographical%20decameron&amp;pg=PP7&amp;ci=66%2C66%2C829%2C1463&amp;source=bookclip){: class="page-image"}

Thomas Frognall Dibdin, *The Bibliographical Decameron; or, Ten Days Pleasant Discourse upon Illuminated Manuscripts and Subjects Connected with Early Engraving, Typography, and Bibliography* (1817) 2 vols.

***

Finally, Dibdin would pen one further work which might go some way to explaining the last of Byron's book sales, the posthumous 1827 sale that occurred three years after Byron had died in Greece. This final work was *Bibliophobia* and described [a drastic turn in the markets around the year 1826](https://academic-oup-com.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/library/article/s6-IX/2/148/984043) which led to a number of publishers going out of business and a general dip in book-collecting of all types.

Thomas Frognall Dibdin, *Bibliophobia. Remarks on the Present Languid and Depressed State of Literature and the Book Trade* (1832).

***

With this trajectory in mind, we can see why, in addition to the time it would have taken to transport Byron's books back from Italy and Greece after his death, there was no rush to try to auction them off. Books in general were not in demand in the same way as eleven years prior and despite his fame, the associational value of these books from Byron's prior ownership would not have overcome the economic conditions.

So, Byron's libraries, in the three recorded states, offer insight not only into Byron's bookish interests, but also into broader patterns of ownership of books in the period.

### Visualizations

So, why attempt to visualize these sales at the scale they were sold? For one, mapping these authors through the sale lists can be enlightening as to Byron's discretion over what books the public were to know he owned, especially as some are omitted from the 1816 sale after appearing in the 1813 list.

The resultant Sankey diagram can map the contributor entities (authors, editors, translators, etc.) through their works in Byron's library catalogues to see just whose volumes are sold and whose go unaccounted for.

<iframe style="width:100%;height:1500px;" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17356463/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" class="flourish-embed-iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"></iframe>

<div style="margin-top:4px;text-align:right;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/17356463/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/17356463" style="text-decoration:none;"> </a></div>

We can adjust this slightly to consider the days of sales and whose works were sold, with the most voluminous selling entities at the top.

<iframe style="width:100%;height:2000px;" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17319881/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" class="flourish-embed-iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"></iframe>

Another possibility is charting the hierarchical structure of [Byron's 1807 reading list](https://lordbyron.org/monograph.php?doc=ThMoore.1830&amp;select=AD1807#!DaHume1776AD1807-23), which he composed upon completing his time at Trinity College, Cambridge. In this memo he lists figures under their representative nations and then genres of writing as a sort of exercise in the breadth and depth of his reading about the world. The resultant sankey diagram shows the streams of authors, nations, and genres that inform this "stock of useful knowledge".

<iframe style="width:100%;height:600px;" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17767889/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" class="flourish-embed-iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"></iframe>

A further visualization which can guide an examination of Byron's library is the network diagram. In the below instance the sales lists (1813, 1816, 1827, and [suspected anonymized sale](https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/10.3828/bj.2013.7) of Byron's further posthumous books in 1827) are connected to their constituent authors.

<iframe style="width:100%;height:600px;" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/18342247/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" class="flourish-embed-iframe" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"></iframe>

These visualizations are just a sampling of the drawing together of books at scale which can be done when leveraging the underlying database of metadata describing Byron's libraries.

Especially with the dynamic interaction enabled through the digital interface, these visualizations can guide our perusals within Byron's library for the individuals works and authors.

Ultimately, when we visualize anything, much as the broad trends can be interesting, it is in the drilling-down within the data to the granular that allows a thorough understanding. That is why these visualizations are important as a guide to further pursuit of the actual items - the books - that this project aims to detail in all their metadata and digital facsimile. After all, when you look at a book shelf, you can judge the books by their covers, but you also will want to read a few of them.

With that said, here is Byron's Total Library as a network, complete with the sales, lots, books, buyers, authors, and more. Try pulling a node away from the mix and watch the network react to this errant node and recompose itself.

### An Afterword:

The Fellowship with the Digital Scholarship Centre at the University of Alberta has enabled me to pursue a part of my research for which I have always had a keen interest: public-facing engagement. While working on the broader project, so much writing, coding, and research happens in isolation. Opportunities to share research are often fleeting presentations at conferences, but with this side to the project there is the possibility of a constant sharing with other scholars. This is both affirming of the merit of this project, while also motivating to continue the work of enhancing and expanding.

To end, three epilogues:

> “To sum up all; there are archives at every stage to be look’d into, and rolls, records, documents, and endless genealogies, which justice ever and anon calls him back to stay the reading of:—In short, there is no end of it;—for my own part, I declare I had been at it these six weeks, making all the speed I possibly could,—and am not yet born.”

>> ~ Laurence Sterne, *Tristram Shandy*, Vol. I, Ch. XIV

*******

> Proudly he shews, with many a smile elate,  
The scrambling subjects of the *private plate*;  
While Time their actions and their names bereaves,  
They grin for ever in the guarded leaves.

>> ~ John Ferriar, *The Bibliomania, An Epistle, To Richard Heber, Esq.*, lines 127-130.

*******

> “I have tried to rescue from oblivion a subaltern horror: the vast, contradictory Library, whose vertical wilderness of books run the incessant risk of changing into others that affirm, deny, and confuse everything like a delirious god.”

>> ~ Jorge Luis Borges, “The Total Library”
