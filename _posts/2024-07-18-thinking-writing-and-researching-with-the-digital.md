A few months ago, the pressure of writing for the Digital Scholarship Centre fellowship came to
mind. At that time and even up to today, I was convinced I wanted to write about photography
and its productive engagements with my research topic: urban informality. We used to believe in
photography as capturing and condensing reality as a representation that deploys many
significances. However, photography is much more than that; it is an engagement with a real that
is actually absent but with the potentiality to actualize the present through memories, narrative
evocations, feelings and emotions (Guggenheim, 2010; Shields, 2003). Photography has many
potentialities: image is mobile instead of static; it speaks of a movement, a practice, a doing. Hi!
My name is Juan, I am from Colombia (the one with the O, not with the U), and I like to study
urban informality. <!-- more --> Urban informality relates to city sectors and neighbourhoods that were neither
planned nor built by developers nor State agencies. They are usually built by the same people,
from low income communities, who inhabit them due the lack of housing and access to the
housing market. When I say ‘I like to study urban informality’, it is because of the relation of
informality and formality (understood as the territory of the State) is salient to comprehending
Colombian society, the formation of state power and the manners in which people confront it. As
part of my research, I try to understand the everyday life of these neighbourhoods through the
relations their inhabitants have with materials, objects and things to highlight how these
neighbourhoods are sites of creativity, resistance and survival. So, when I was doing my
fieldwork back in Colombia, I decided to ‘capture’ these everyday aspects of these
neighbourhoods through photos and video recordings to gather my project’s ‘data’. However, the
moment I decided to sit down and start writing for this blog, I began to think about the digital
aspects of my research and the informal practices I encountered. I wanted to share my
exploration and potentialities of photography and video recording to do research in these
settlements, but as I was reading and writing -- something you learn in doctoral studies is that
writing is the act of reading and reading is the act of writing --, this process made me realized
about the intricacies of the digital in human life, and urban informality. In the process of thinking
with the digital, I noticed how there are practices of informal transportation that operate with a
social media app as their ally and how fruitful this practice is to observe the interconnection with
the digital even in sites of marginalization, exclusion, and higher vulnerability (Hutchinson,
2016).

I am writing from a very generic definition of digital. I consider the digital to be media,
having a property to mediate and facilitate different interactions among humans, and between
humans and nonhumans. In media, there is an infrastructural exchange and a productive platform
that allows circulation, transactions and a co-shaping of the social through the medium
(McLuhan, 2001; Mitchell, 2017). In this case, I want to share how apps that we have on our
mobile phones are taken for granted in terms of their potentialities and what they can afford to
humans, to explore and utilize their potency in unimaginable and different ways. And how apps,
vehicles, humans, cellphones and other nonhumans make possible, through their interactions
with each other, informal transportation in Colombia.

One of my research activities was mapping informal transportation modes in various
neighbourhoods in two Colombian cities. I noticed that drivers use their cell phones to access a
social network called WhatsApp™ to facilitate the flow, circulation and relations of informal
transportation. Drivers, car owners and passengers communicate through this social network to
keep the routes and the service working. This social network is free, and according to its owner
Meta™, is an end-to-end encrypted private message service that allows the circulation of text,
voice calls, photos, videos, documents and location (WhatsApp LLC, 2024).

Why is this medium so peculiar or particular? How can a global corporation with such
profitable margins facilitate informality? Urban informality usually lacks access to minimal
public services; people from these settlements need to informally and sometimes illegally
connect to formal grids or to find innovative ways to connect to them and sometimes to make
some money out of these connective forms. In some cases, they have access and connection to
public services, but their provision differs from other neighbourhoods of higher strata or
conditions. For instance, in the Colombian case, there is a sociolegal resource allocation and
classification system that divides city neighbourhoods between six strata, which also determine
provision and forms to provide public services (see Guevara &amp; Shields, 2019). Informal
settlements are in the lower strata, facing social stigma, marginalization and persecution from the
State for being at its boundaries by creating unregulated and unplanned neighbourhoods.

In the case of informal transportation, WhatsApp™ and other apps operate as an
infrastructure that makes the functioning of informal practices possible, providing particular
relations and possibilities. Informal transportation uses mobile device applications to measure
distances and charge the ride according to those measurements. Social networks allow
communication, control and dispatch rides and pickups. Always sharing their location, drivers
appear to be in one place while being followed by operators and managers of the WhatsApp™
groups, providing a sense of security to all the parts involved. This specific form of informal
transportation competes with formal transport and multinational corporations that mediate the
connection between drivers, transportation providers and customers through their apps. These
apps have positioned this kind of transportation service door-to-door, emulating the service of
taxis and cabs, creating a different hierarchy and dominant position in their service. Informal
transport routes and groups take advantage of the digital world, showing the ambivalence and
gaps of State power and economic dominance by capitalism to create another market outside the
imposed rules of the State and through transactions that do not necessarily always seek profit.
The ambivalence of these engagements of the informal and the digital shows what
professor Ravi Sundaram (2015) calls online shadows, a coexistence of strategies from the State
and global corporations to conduce social practices towards capitalism and profit generation
through digital media while tactical engagements confront, reject and make possible other worlds
of differentiation and possibility outside these imposed logics. Informal transportation as an
economic practice of survival involves a living and tactical relationality with an extended media
that is facilitated by the digital to exemplify how our actualities are in constant mediation even
when living at the borders of society and through unthinkable allies.
